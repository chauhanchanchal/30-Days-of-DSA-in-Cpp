## 🎯 Goal of Day 02
The goal of Day 02 is to understand how a program **makes decisions** and **repeats actions**.  
Conditional statements and loops are the logical foundation required to solve problems in **Data Structures and Algorithms**.

---

## 1. Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow a program to execute different blocks of code based on a given condition.

### 1. Conditional Statements
Conditional statements are used to make decisions in a program based on certain conditions.

- **if statement**  
  Executes a block of code only when the given condition is true.

- **if–else statement**  
  Executes one block of code if the condition is true and another block if the condition is false.
int num = 7;
if (num % 2 == 0) {
    cout << "Even number";
} else {
    cout << "Odd number";
}

- **if–else–if ladder**  
  Used to check multiple conditions one by one. The first condition that evaluates to true gets executed.

### 4. Loops in C++
Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specific condition is met.

- **for loop**  
  Used when the number of iterations is known in advance. It consists of initialization, condition checking, and update.

- **while loop**  
  Used when the number of iterations is not known. The condition is checked before executing the loop body.

- **do–while loop**  
  Executes the loop body at least once because the condition is checked after execution.

---

### 5. Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements are used to change the normal flow of a loop.

- **break statement**  
  Terminates the loop immediately when a specific condition is met.

- **continue statement**  
  Skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration.

---

### 6. Nested Loops
Nested loops are loops inside another loop.

- The outer loop controls the number of rows.
- The inner loop controls the number of columns.
- Commonly used in pattern problems and matrix-based problems.

---

### 7. Practice and Implementation
- Writing programs using conditional statements  
- Solving problems using different types of loops  
- Practicing logic building through simple problems  
- Implementing and testing programs in VS Code
